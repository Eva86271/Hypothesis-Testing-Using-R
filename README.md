# Hypothesis-Testing-Using-R
*Hypothesis testing* in statistics is a way for you to test the results of a survey or experiment to see if you have meaningful results.
The aim of the below investigation is to compare the pricing of various products between the two Supermarkets,
Coles and Woolsworth and to conclude which has the cheaper price rates for products in the market. To analyse
the pricing,a total of 76 products has been considered as sample size from respective supermarkets(152 prices
has been noted in total).We intend to take a large sample for the reason to minimize the standard error of the
population as a large sample approaches to have a normal distribution.The selection has been made on the basis
of availabilty of products in the supermarkets by considering the trends on websites of the supermarkets:
www.coles.com.au and www.woolworths.com.au. The selection has been done randomly from various categories
of available products in both the supermarket which includes various category such as variou Food
categories,Baby Products,Beauty Products.Toiletries .Due to the unavailibity of many products in one of the super
market or variation in sales strategy for brands hence ,we were not able to have an full list of product list of the
supermarkets hence we chose about the items which were readily available in both the market to ensure the
equivalence in the quality,quantity,ingredients and other properties.The methods that are being used for summary
statistics will be descriptive statistic and the box-plotting,we will be also be demonstrating whether the prices are
normally distributed or not by various methods mainly the Q-Q Plot,Shapiro-Wilk test,Histogram and provide the
assumption for the distribution .

The repository have all the codes including the report prepared . It was a team effort where each member contributed equally in understanding and brainstorming.
